- Get comfortable

- Relax your body by releasing any areas of tension

- You're at a hackathon... You've been coding for hours...

- Forget about bugs... Forget about method errors...

- Close your eyes...

- Actually don't close your eyes...

- Breathe deeply in, drawing air fully into your lungs....

- And release the air...

- Breathe in again, slowly....

- And breathe out.....

- Draw a deep breath in....

- And out....

- In.....

- Out.....ğŸŒ¬

- Become more and more relaxed with each breath...

- In.....

- Out..... ğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤
